Periodically, you may be asked to select a sponsor for a particular session of WeatherBug use. If you decide to select a sponsor in this instance, you will be presented with that sponsor's marketing message through banner advertisements and/or a visit to a page on the sponsor's website. Advertisements will generally be displayed within the frame of the WeatherBug application. Moreover, we may deliver topical weather reports and news and information from our weather experts in separate browser windows that may have advertisements as well. You will ONLY be shown advertisements from the Software when the Software is actively displaying weather information in a window on your screen.

5. Installation, Operation and Removal.

UPON INSTALLATION OF THE FUN WEB PRODUCTS/MYWEBSEARCH PRODUCT, THE FOLLOWING FEATURES WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR BROWSER:

SEARCH BOX will: add a toolbar to your Internet browser. The browser toolbar is customizable and will provide you with easy access to search results from several of the best search engines on the Internet.

THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ALL FEATURES) CAN BE UNINSTALLED FROM THE "ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS" DIALOG BOX IN THE WINDOWS CONTROL PANEL, WHERE IT IS LISTED AS "MY WEB SEARCH BROWSER."

The Software does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.). Further, the Software does not: (a) collect or report back to us any information about sites you visit on the Internet; (b) collect or "screen-scrape" any search queries or information that you provide to any other web sites; (c) serve pop-ups when you are on other websites; or (d) collect or report back to Licensor any data regarding your computer keystrokes or other data unrelated to the services the Software provides.

The Software, in the course of processing a given search query, sends a request to our servers. This request includes the keyword query, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous unique ID, and a code which identifies the distribution source of the Software used by you to conduct your search. We use this information in order to properly process your search request. For example, this data provides us with: information on which language you prefer to use; aggregated click information for the purpose of ensuring that our search partners are appropriately compensating us; information that allows us to make accurate payments to our distributors; aggregated usage and retention information; and aggregated search query information for the purpose of further monetizing commercially oriented search keywords.

Importantly, all information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. In addition, all information about search activity is evaluated only on an aggregated basis (excepted in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process), and we do not disclose any non-aggregated information to third parties, except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect someone's safety.

The Software also uses "cookies". We do this for two reasons. First, we use the cookies to store a code designating a distribution source for the Software. This information allows us to properly distinguish Software for purposes of compensating third parties who distribute our product and to analyze retention and usage on an aggregated basis. Second, the Software uses cookies to store user preferences. For example, we use a cookie to record which search engine you have selected as your default provider. We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties, except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order or to protect someone's safety.

The Software also sends a configuration request when you start your browser. This request is approximately 5k in size and includes only anonymous data such as IP address, browser type, and information about the specific release date and distribution source of your Software, as outlined above. Again, all of this information is kept strictly anonymous, is non-personally identifiable, and is used only for purposes of delivering search services and content in accordance with your preferences and providing us with data on an aggregated basis relating to retention, usage, and monetization.

If you wish to withdraw your consent to the communication and data usage as described herein, you should uninstall the Software from your computer. You may uninstall or remove the Software at any time by following the instructions on the Website, or using the Windows add/remove programs function to remove the Software. Each of the Software's component features can be hidden or deactivated using the dropdown menu on the toolbar which the Software installs in your Internet browser.

6. Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Software and each of the related web sites (the "Web Sites") maintained by ASK JEEVES ("we" or "us"). In the event of any inconsistency between this privacy policy and a policy listed on one of the other Web Sites, this policy shall control.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (such as names or email addresses) about users of the Software or the Web Sites ("you"). We do not sell, rent or trade any personally identifiable information you provide when using the Software or the Web Sites.

If you choose to provide us with an email address, we will not send an email to you unless you specifically request an email response to a customer service inquiry or contact is required in order to protect someone's safety or to enforce our Terms of Service. You are not required to provide an email address to use the Software or the Web Sites.

When you visit the Web Sites, we may place a small text file - called a "cookie" - on your computer that allows us to identify your Web browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, and to store your preferences and settings. Importantly, a cookie does not allow us to obtain any personally identifiable information (such as your real name or address) unless you have specifically provided such information when using the Web Sites or the Software.

We also capture your source IP address which is a standard practice for most internet sites. We in no way associate your IP address with any cookies and do not use your IP address in conjunction with any personally identifiable information.

If any of the Web Sites or the Software is ever sold or all or substantially all of the assets relating to a Web Site or the Software are transferred to another entity, we may transfer all information provided by or collected from you, including personally identifiable information, in order to ensure continuity of your service.

We will disclose information, including personally identifiable information, data acquired by cookies, and other data, where required by a subpoena, interception order or other lawful process. We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe, in our sole judgment and to the extent consistent with applicable law, that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of others or to enforce, or protect our rights under, this Agreement.

7. Your Obligations
